4. How do you count the number of occurrences of a specific word in a file using the command line?
	Short: Using grep command, we can count the number of occurances of a specified keyword in the required file.

	grep -o 'word' filename: searches for the occurances of the word in the file and outputs each occurance on a separate line 
	wc -l: this counts the number of lines 

5. How do you find and replace a specific word in a file using the command line?
	Short: Streame Editor 'sed' command does the job, it replaces the old_word with new_word 
	Command: sed -i 's/old_word/new_word/g' filename
	-i : this allows in-place editing, directly modifies the file 
	's/old_word/new_word/g' : substitution command for sed, it replaces the old_word with new_word

6. How do you display the size of a file in human-readable format using the command line?

9. How do you kill a process using its process ID (PID) using the command line?
	Short: 'kill' command with PID, kills the specified process.
	Command: kill PID | kill 12345
	
	Long: By default, 'kill' command sends a SIGTERM signal to the process, which is a gentle request for termination. If the process doesn't respond to the SIGTERM signal, we can forcefully kill the process using -9 command.
	Command: kill -9 PID 

10. How do you create a compressed tar archive of a directory and exclude specific files from it using the command line?
	Short: Using 'tar' and '--exclude' commands, we can compress archive of a directory and excluding the specfied files.

	-c : create a new archive
	-z : compress the archive using gzip
	-v : optional, this shows the on-going progress of the archiving
	-f : specify the filename of the archive 
	--exclude='pattern' : excludes the specified file called pattern
	directory_name : name of the directory which we want to archive 
	archive_name.tar.gz : replace this with the desired name for archive which we want 
	'pattern' : exclude with the specific pattern. If we want to exclude all files with specific extension, we can mention '*.log' - excludes all files with the extension .log
	
11. How do you set an environment variable in Linux using the command line?
	Short: Using 'export' command with 'value', we can set the environment variable. We can also set multiple variables in a single command line argument
	Command: export VARIABLE_NAME = "value"
	Ex: export my_var = "hello" my_var2 = "nag" my_var3 = "welcome"
	
	Long: If we want these environment variables to be present across terminal sessions, we need to add them under the shell configuration files such as '.bashrc' or '.bash_profile' or '.zshrc'. So that they are avaialble even when nwe close and create new terminal window.

12. How do you list all installed packages on a Debian-based Linux distribution using the command line?
	Short: Using 'dpkg' package manager command, along with 'grep' to filter out the package names.
	Command: dpkg --get_selections | grep -v deinstall 
	dpkg --get_selections : this command lists all the installed packages along with their selection state (such as 'install' or 'deinstall')
	grep -v deinstall : this filter out any packages that are marked for deinstallation, ensures that only currently installed packages are listed
	If terminal scrolls through the list too quickly, use the pipe with 'less' command for a easier viewing.
	Ex: dpkg --get_selections | grep -v deinstall | less
	If we want to save the installed package list, we can redirect them into a new file as shown below
	Ex: dpkg --get_selections | grep -v deinstall > installed_packages.txt

13. How do you change the permissions of a file to read-only for the owner and group using the command line?
	Short: Using 'chmod 447 filename' or 'chmod r--r--rwx filename'
	If others also granted with read-only, then - chmod 444 filename or chmod r--r--r-- filename 

14. How do you find all files with a specific extension in a directory and its subdirectories using the command line?
	Short: Using 'find' and 'name' commands
	Command: find /path/to/directory -type f name "*.extension"
	/path/to/directory : path of the directory which we want to start the search. We can provide '.' if we want to search in the current directory and sub-directories associated with it
	'*.extensio' : recurssively searches for the files with mentioned extension in current and sub-directories and print their paths

15. How do you create a backup of a file with a timestamp in its filename using the command line?
	Short: Using 'cp' along with 'date' command
	Command: cp filename "$(date +'%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S')_filename.extension"
	filename : replace this with the file we want to create a backup
	$(date +'%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S') : this generates the timestamp in the mentioned date format, we can change the format as well
	_filename.extension : timestamp gets added as a suffix to this filename 

16. How do you search for a specific string in all files within a directory and its subdirectories using the command line?
	Short: Using 'grep' and '-r' (recursive), we can search for the specific string in mentioned directory as well as its sub-directories

	Ex: df -h /dev/sda1

20. How do you schedule a command or script to run at a specific time using the cron system?
	Short: Using 'crontab', we can schedule a command or script to run at specified time.
	crontab -e : to open the our crontab's file for editing 
	If we are opening the crontab for the first time, it prompts to choose the editor ex nano or vim.
	Syntax for crontab: Minute Hour Day of Month Month Day of Week Command
